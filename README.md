## Overview

Big Bunny Little Bunny is a game created for the GMTK Game Jam 2024. It was coded in Godot by GugloPWN with art by Ghooost. The game jam was 96 hours long but further additions and improvements are planned. The game is a platformer where you jump and avoid spikes while trying to get to the end. The main gameplay gimmick is that the player character and physics scale with the players Y poisition. As the player moves upward the player gets larger and as they move downward they get smaller.
